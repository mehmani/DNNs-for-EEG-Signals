# Bidirectional Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Disentangling Brain Activity from EEG Data

In this study a collected students' EEG brain activity while watching online courses (video clips) is used to train a classifier that detects when a student is confused. In doing so, a bidirectional recurrent convolutional networks classifier is used.

## Data:
A data set is from the 'EEG brain wave for confusion[1]'; EEG data from 10 students assigned to watch 20 videos, after each video, students rated their confusion level on a sclae of 1-7. These labels are quantized into two classes: (i) Confused, and (ii) Not confused
Table 1 shows the features of this data set.
